This case study contains an example of what would happen if I start from a fully
monitored feeder and then I remove
1) first, all Q measurements at the customers (feeder is still determined)
2) secondly, all P measurements (feeder is now underdetermined)
3) finally, all |U| measurements (feeder is now strongly underdetermined)
