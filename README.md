This repository contains results and example scripts for the paper:

"A Framework for Constrained Static State Estimation in Unbalanced Distribution Networks"

The csv files in result_files/clean_csv_files are the ones used to generate the figures in the v1 version of the paper in arXiv.
The scripts should allow the user to reproduce similar results. Variations on the results can occur depending on the solver, package versions and/or machine used. The paper details the condition in which our results were generated. 

For the open-source state estimation package please refer to: https://github.com/Electa-Git/PowerModelsDistributionStateEstimation.jl.

This repository might not be updated with the results presented in the future versions of the paper: differences might arise during the review process and the subsequent different versions of the paper. Also, these scripts were not tried on a different machine, and it might be necessary to edit information relative to e.g. paths in order to use the code.

Feel free to contact me in case of doubts or mistakes.
