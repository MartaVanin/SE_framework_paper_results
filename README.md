This repository contains the results and scripts for the paper:

"A Framework for Constrained Static State Estimation in Unbalanced Distribution Networks"

The csv files in result_files/clean_csv_files are the ones ultimately used to generate the figures in the papers.
The scripts should allow the user to reproduce the paper results and/or perform similar exercises. Variations on the results can occur depending on the solver, package versions and/or machine used. The paper details the condition in which our results were generated.

We will do the best to try and keep this repository updated with the results presented in the paper, but differences might arise during the review process and the subsequent different versions of the paper. Also, these scripts were not tried on a different machine, and it might be necessary to edit information relative to e.g. paths in order to use the code.

Please contact me in case of doubts or mistakes.
